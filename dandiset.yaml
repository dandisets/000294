description: 'This dataset contains simultaneous intracellular whole-cell patch clamp
  and extracellular high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recordings.

  It includes data from two files, corresponding to two recorded neurons. Each NWB
  file contains several runs of 8 eCode protocols, with syncronized intracellular
  voltages, stimulus currents, and extracellular voltages.'
